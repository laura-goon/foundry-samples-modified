# What this sample demonstrates

An [Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) agent with **native file-based skills** hosted using the **Responses protocol**. It shows how to add a `SkillsProvider` to an agent so skills in a local `skills/` folder are discovered automatically and can use the same Azure credentials as the rest of the Foundry agent.

The included `travel-guide` skill can create a colorful PDF city travel guide by running a bundled Python script. The script uses only the Python standard library so there is no extra PDF package to install.

## How It Works

### Model Integration

The agent uses `FoundryChatClient` from the Agent Framework to create a Responses client from the project endpoint and model deployment. The agent supports both streaming (SSE events) and non-streaming (JSON) response modes.

See [main.py](src/agent-framework-agent-with-skills-responses/main.py) for the full implementation.

### Skills

The sample creates a `SkillsProvider` pointed at the local [skills](skills/) directory:

```python
skills_provider = SkillsProvider(
    skill_paths=Path(__file__).parent / "skills",
    script_runner=run_local_skill_script,
)
```

Agent Framework discovers the [travel-guide](skills/travel-guide/) skill from its `SKILL.md` file and advertises it to the model. When the user asks for a travel guide, the model can load the skill instructions and run `scripts/create_travel_guide.py` through the configured script runner.

### Agent Hosting

The agent is hosted using the [Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) with the `ResponsesHostServer`, which provisions a REST API endpoint compatible with the OpenAI Responses protocol.

## Option 1: Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** — [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
2. Install the AI agent extension:
   ```bash
   azd ext install microsoft.foundry
   ```
3. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

### Initialize the agent project

No cloning required. Create a new folder and initialize from the manifest:

```bash
mkdir my-skills-agent && cd my-skills-agent

azd ai agent init -m https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/python/hosted-agents/agent-framework/responses/07-skills/azure.yaml
```

Follow the prompts to configure your Foundry project and model deployment. If you don't have an existing Foundry project, `azd ai agent init` will guide you through creating one.

### Provision Azure resources (if needed)

If you don't already have a Foundry project and model deployment:

```bash
azd provision
```

### Run the agent locally

```bash
azd ai agent run
```

The agent host will start on `http://localhost:8088`.

### Invoke the local agent

In a separate terminal, from the project directory:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "Create a colorful 3-day PDF travel guide for Lisbon focused on food, viewpoints, and neighborhoods."
```

The skill writes the PDF to `$HOME/generated-travel-guides` and returns a file path. For production scenarios that need durable external sharing, update the skill script to upload the PDF to storage and return a shareable URL.

### Deploy to Foundry

Once tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
azd deploy
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Deploy a hosted agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/deploy-hosted-agent).

### Invoke the deployed agent

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "Create a colorful 3-day PDF travel guide for Lisbon focused on food, viewpoints, and neighborhoods."
```

## Option 2: VS Code (Foundry Toolkit)

### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code** with the **[Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azure-ai-foundry)** extension installed.
2. Sign in to Azure in VS Code.

### Create the project

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Create Hosted Agent**.
2. Select this sample from the gallery. The extension scaffolds the project into a new workspace and generates `agent.yaml`, `.env`, and `.vscode/tasks.json` + `launch.json` automatically.
3. Complete the **Foundry Project Setup** to pick the subscription and Foundry project (or create a new one).

### Run and debug the agent

Press **F5** to start the agent in debug mode. The agent host will start on `http://localhost:8088`.

### Test with Agent Inspector

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**.
2. The Inspector connects to the running agent. Send messages to chat and view streamed responses.

### Deploy to Foundry

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate settings.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to select subscription and project.
3. On the **Basics** tab, choose deployment method (**Code** or **Container**) and confirm the agent name.
4. On **Review + Deploy**, confirm runtime details, pick **CPU and Memory** size, and click **Deploy**.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.
