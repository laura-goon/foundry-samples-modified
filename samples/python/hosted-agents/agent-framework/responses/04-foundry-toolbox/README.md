# Agent with Foundry Toolbox (Responses Protocol)

An [Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) agent that uses **Foundry Toolbox** for tool discovery, hosted on Microsoft Foundry using the **Responses protocol**. Foundry Toolbox is a managed tool registry in Microsoft Foundry that lets you define tools centrally and share them across agents.

## Creating a Foundry Toolbox

You can create a Foundry Toolbox by code. Refer to this sample for an example: [Foundry Toolbox CRUD Sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/ai/azure-ai-projects/samples/hosted_agents/sample_toolboxes_crud.py).

You can also create a Foundry Toolbox in the Foundry portal. Read more about it [in the Foundry toolbox documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/tools/toolbox).

This sample consumes a toolbox over its MCP endpoint. It bundles a [`toolbox.yaml`](toolbox.yaml) that defines two connectionless tools behind one endpoint:

- **Web search**, which grounds responses in real-time public web results.
- The **Microsoft Learn MCP server** (`https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp`), a public endpoint that grounds responses in official Microsoft documentation and requires no authentication.

You create the toolbox once from `toolbox.yaml`, then copy the versioned MCP endpoint it prints into the `TOOLBOX_ENDPOINT` environment variable. The agent connects to that endpoint at runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> To attach tools that need credentials (MCP servers with API keys or OAuth, Azure AI Search, Bing Custom Search, and more), create a project connection first and reference it from `toolbox.yaml`. For connection-backed examples, see the [`langgraph-toolbox`](../../../bring-your-own/responses/langgraph-toolbox/README.md) and [`langgraph-toolbox-user-identity`](../../../bring-your-own/responses/langgraph-toolbox-user-identity/README.md) samples, and the [supported toolbox scenarios](https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/python/hosted-agents/SUPPORTED_TOOLBOX_SCENARIOS.md).

## How it works

### Model Integration

The agent uses `FoundryChatClient` from the Agent Framework to create an OpenAI-compatible Responses client. It connects to the toolbox's MCP endpoint via `MCPStreamableHTTPTool`, which discovers and invokes the toolbox's tools over MCP at runtime. The agent resolves the endpoint from the `TOOLBOX_ENDPOINT` environment variable. If that variable isn't set, it builds the latest-version endpoint from `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` and `TOOLBOX_NAME`.

See [main.py](main.py) for the full implementation.

## Running the agent

### Option 1: Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

#### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** — [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) (1.25 or later)
2. Install the unified Foundry CLI extension bundle (provides `azd ai agent`, `connection`, `inspector`, `project`, `routine`, `skill`, and `toolbox`):
   ```bash
   # If you previously installed individual extensions, uninstall them first:
   #   azd ext uninstall azure.ai.agents
   #   azd ext uninstall azure.ai.toolboxes
   azd ext install microsoft.foundry
   ```
3. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

#### Initialize the agent project

No cloning required. Create a new folder and initialize from the manifest:

```bash
mkdir my-toolbox-agent && cd my-toolbox-agent

azd ai agent init -m https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/python/hosted-agents/agent-framework/responses/04-foundry-toolbox/agent.manifest.yaml
```

Follow the prompts to configure your Foundry project and model deployment. If you don't have an existing Foundry project, `azd ai agent init` will guide you through creating one. Initializing also sets the selected project as the active project for the `azd ai` commands that follow.

#### Create the toolbox with `azd ai`

> [!TIP]
> If you use GitHub Copilot for Azure to scaffold a hosted agent that consumes this toolbox, the following skill references describe the same endpoint contract (env var, headers, MCP protocol, citation patterns, and troubleshooting) that the agent must implement:
>
> - [Toolbox reference](https://github.com/microsoft/GitHub-Copilot-for-Azure/blob/main/plugin/skills/microsoft-foundry/foundry-agent/create/references/toolbox-reference.md) — endpoint format, MCP protocol, OAuth consent handling, citation patterns, and troubleshooting.
> - [Use toolbox in a hosted agent](https://github.com/microsoft/GitHub-Copilot-for-Azure/blob/main/plugin/skills/microsoft-foundry/foundry-agent/create/references/use-toolbox-in-hosted-agent.md) — endpoint resolution, env-var contract, payload shape, code integration patterns, and tracing.

The agent reads the toolbox's MCP endpoint from `TOOLBOX_ENDPOINT`. Create the toolbox once from the bundled [`toolbox.yaml`](toolbox.yaml):

```bash
azd ai toolbox create my-toolbox --from-file ./toolbox.yaml
```

The first version becomes the default automatically. Use `azd ai toolbox list`, `azd ai toolbox show my-toolbox`, and `azd ai toolbox version list my-toolbox` to inspect, and `azd ai toolbox delete my-toolbox --force` to remove it.

To stage incremental changes safely, use `azd ai toolbox connection add/remove` and `azd ai toolbox skill add/list/remove` &mdash; each creates a new toolbox version that carries forward existing connections and skills but **doesn't** change the default. Promote a version with `azd ai toolbox publish my-toolbox <version>` when you're ready to make it active.

`azd ai toolbox create` prints the toolbox's versioned MCP endpoint. Copy that endpoint and store it in your `azd` environment so the agent connects to it:

```bash
azd env set TOOLBOX_ENDPOINT "https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>/toolboxes/my-toolbox/versions/1/mcp?api-version=v1"
```

#### Provision Azure resources (if needed)

If you don't already have a Foundry project and model deployment:

```bash
azd provision
```

#### Run the agent locally

```bash
azd ai agent run
```

The agent host will start on `http://localhost:8088`.

#### Invoke the local agent

In a separate terminal, from the project directory:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "What tools do you have?"
```

#### Deploy to Foundry

Once tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
azd deploy
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Deploy a hosted agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/deploy-hosted-agent).

#### Invoke the deployed agent

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "What tools do you have?"
```

### Option 2: VS Code (Foundry Toolkit)

#### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code** with the **[Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azure-ai-foundry)** extension installed.
2. Sign in to Azure in VS Code.
3. The `my-toolbox` toolbox must exist in your Foundry project. Create it from the bundled [`toolbox.yaml`](toolbox.yaml) (`azd ai toolbox create my-toolbox --from-file ./toolbox.yaml`) or in the Foundry portal before you run the agent.

#### Create the project

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Create Hosted Agent**.
2. Select this sample from the gallery. The extension scaffolds the project into a new workspace and generates `agent.yaml`, `.env`, and `.vscode/tasks.json` + `launch.json` automatically.
3. Complete the **Foundry Project Setup** to pick the subscription and Foundry project (or create a new one).

#### Run and debug the agent

Press **F5** to start the agent in debug mode. The agent host will start on `http://localhost:8088`.

#### Test with Agent Inspector

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**.
2. The Inspector connects to the running agent. Send messages to chat and view streamed responses.

#### Deploy to Foundry

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate settings.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to select subscription and project.
3. On the **Basics** tab, choose deployment method (**Code** or **Container**) and confirm the agent name.
4. On **Review + Deploy**, confirm runtime details, pick **CPU and Memory** size, and click **Deploy**.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.
