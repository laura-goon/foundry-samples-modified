# What this sample demonstrates

A minimal "hello world" hosted agent using the **Bring Your Own** approach with the **Responses protocol** in C#. It shows how to use the [`Azure.AI.AgentServer.Responses`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.AgentServer.Responses/) SDK to host a custom agent that calls a Foundry model via the Responses API and returns the reply through the standard Responses protocol contract.

This is the simplest possible BYO integration — the protocol SDK handles the HTTP endpoints, SSE lifecycle, health probes, and OpenTelemetry tracing. You supply the model call using the [Foundry SDK (`Azure.AI.Projects` + `Azure.AI.Extensions.OpenAI`)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.Extensions.OpenAI/).

## How It Works

### Model Integration

The agent uses the Foundry SDK to create a `ProjectResponsesClient` from the project endpoint and model deployment name. When a request arrives, the handler fetches conversation history via `GetHistoryAsync()`, builds an input list, calls the model via the Responses API, and returns the reply as a `TextResponse` — which the SDK automatically wraps in the correct SSE lifecycle events (`response.created` → `response.in_progress` → content events → `response.completed`).

See [Program.cs](src/hello-world-dotnet-responses/Program.cs) for the full implementation.

### Agent Hosting

The agent is hosted using the [Azure AI AgentServer Responses SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.AgentServer.Responses/), which provisions a REST API endpoint compatible with the OpenAI Responses protocol.

### Agent Deployment

The hosted agent can be developed and deployed to Microsoft Foundry using the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/quickstarts/quickstart-hosted-agent?view=foundry&pivots=azd).

## Prerequisites

1. An existing Foundry project with a deployed model (or create them during setup in Option 1 — `azd provision` can create them for you).
2. **[.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)** or later.

### Environment variables

See [`.env.example`](src/hello-world-dotnet-responses/.env.example) or `.env` for the full list of environment variables this sample uses.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | Yes | Foundry project endpoint. Auto-injected in hosted containers; set automatically by `azd ai agent run` locally. |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | Yes | Model deployment name — must match your Foundry project deployment. Declared in `azure.yaml`. |
| `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` | Recommended | Enables telemetry. Auto-injected in hosted containers; set manually for local dev. |

When using `azd ai agent run`, these are handled automatically. For manual runs, set them in your shell — .NET does not read `.env` files natively.

## Option 1: Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** — [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
2. Install the Foundry extension:

   ```bash
   azd ext install microsoft.foundry
   ```

3. Authenticate:

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

### Initialize the agent project

No cloning required. Create a new folder and initialize from the manifest:

```bash
mkdir hello-world-agent && cd hello-world-agent
azd ai agent init -m https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/csharp/hosted-agents/bring-your-own/responses/HelloWorld/azure.yaml
```

Follow the prompts to configure your Foundry project and model deployment. If you don't have an existing Foundry project, `azd ai agent init` will guide you through creating one.

> If you already have a Foundry project and model deployment, add `-p <project-id> -d <deployment-name>` to `azd ai agent init` to target existing resources.

### Provision Azure resources (if needed)

If you don't already have a Foundry project and model deployment:

```bash
azd provision
```

### Run the agent locally

```bash
azd ai agent run
```

The agent host will start on `http://localhost:8088`.

### Invoke the local agent

In a separate terminal, invoke the running agent:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "What is Microsoft Foundry?"
```

Or use curl directly:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "What is Microsoft Foundry?", "stream": false}' | jq .
```

### Deploy to Foundry

Once tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
azd deploy
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Deploy a hosted agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/deploy-hosted-agent).

### Invoke the deployed agent

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "What is Microsoft Foundry?"
```

Stream logs from the running agent with `azd ai agent monitor`.

## Option 2: VS Code (Foundry Toolkit)

### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code** with the **[Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio)** extension installed.
2. [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension.
3. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **C#: Check Workspace Requirements** to confirm the toolchain is ready.

### Run and debug the agent

Press **F5** to start the agent. The agent starts and the **Agent Inspector** opens automatically. Chat with the agent in the Inspector.

### Or run manually, then open the Inspector

1. Restore dependencies:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

2. Set the required environment variables (see [Environment variables](#environment-variables)):

   ```bash
   export FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
   export AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="<your-model-deployment-name>"
   ```

3. Sign in to Azure with the Azure CLI:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

4. Start the agent (listens on `http://localhost:8088`):

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**, then send a message to test.

### Deploy to Foundry

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate settings.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to select subscription and project.
3. On the **Basics** tab, choose deployment method (**Code** or **Container**) and confirm the agent name.
4. On **Review + Deploy**, confirm runtime details, pick **CPU and Memory** size, and click **Deploy**.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.

## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

**Deploy with `azd deploy`**, which uses ACR remote build and always produces images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds:**

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t image .
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
