# Env Vars Agent — Responses Protocol

This sample demonstrates Foundry's **connection-templated environment-variable injection** in a hosted agent. Four example env vars are declared in `azure.yaml` — covering all four corners of the connection grid (ApiKey × CustomKeys × secret × non-secret) — and injected into the container at runtime by the platform's secret resolver.

The agent exposes a single function-calling tool, `get_env_var(name, kind)`, that returns the runtime value with a **kind-aware safety policy**:

| `kind` | Returned to the model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `metadata` | The **whole value** | Plain, non-secret data (region, account name, feature flags, …) stored in the connection's metadata bag. |
| `target` | The **whole value** | The connection's endpoint URL — also plain, non-secret. |
| `credentials` (default) | A **safe fingerprint** (length + first 4 chars + placeholder-resolved check) | Secrets must never leave the agent. The fingerprint is enough to confirm the placeholder resolved without exposing the value. |

### The four example env vars

| Env var | Connection (kind) | Placeholder | Tool `kind` | Returned |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_API_KEY` | `dummy-api-key` (ApiKey) | `${{connections.dummy-api-key.credentials.key}}` | `credentials` | fingerprint |
| `TARGET` | `dummy-api-key` (ApiKey) | `${{connections.dummy-api-key.target}}` | `target` | whole value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | `dummy-custom-keys` (CustomKeys) | `${{connections.dummy-custom-keys.credentials.secret-key}}` | `credentials` | fingerprint |
| `NON_SECRET_KEY` | `dummy-custom-keys` (CustomKeys) | `${{connections.dummy-custom-keys.metadata.plain-key}}` | `metadata` | whole value |

Built with [Azure.AI.AgentServer.Responses](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.AgentServer.Responses) (BYO — no Agent Framework). The model call uses **Azure AI Projects + the Responses API** (`Azure.AI.Projects` + `Azure.AI.Extensions.OpenAI`).

## How It Works

1. **Connection setup (one-time)**: in your Foundry project, create
   - an **ApiKey** connection named `dummy-api-key` (give it a `target` URL and a `key`), and
   - a **CustomKeys** connection named `dummy-custom-keys` with two custom keys — `secret-key` (marked **as secret**) and `plain-key` (plain).
2. **Template declaration**: `azure.yaml` declares the four env vars with placeholder values:
   ```yaml
   - name: SECRET_API_KEY
     value: "${{connections.dummy-api-key.credentials.key}}"
   - name: TARGET
     value: "${{connections.dummy-api-key.target}}"
   - name: SECRET_KEY
     value: "${{connections.dummy-custom-keys.credentials.secret-key}}"
   - name: NON_SECRET_KEY
     value: "${{connections.dummy-custom-keys.metadata.plain-key}}"
   ```
3. **Runtime resolution**: when the agent container starts, the Foundry platform reads each named connection, resolves each placeholder, and injects the resulting value into the env var.
4. **Agent execution**: the agent receives natural language messages via `POST /responses`. The Responses-API function-calling loop decides which env var to inspect and which `kind` to pass:
   - `get_env_var("TARGET", "target")` → `{ status: "RESOLVED", value: "https://api.example.com", … }`
   - `get_env_var("SECRET_API_KEY", "credentials")` → `{ status: "RESOLVED", length: 32, head: "ab12", … }` *(no raw value)*
   - `get_env_var("NON_SECRET_KEY", "metadata")` → `{ status: "RESOLVED", value: "westus2", … }`
   - `get_env_var("SECRET_KEY", "credentials")` → `{ status: "RESOLVED", length: 24, head: "p@ss", … }` *(no raw value)*
5. The model's tool result is fed back for a natural-language reply.

## Prerequisites

1. An existing Foundry project with a deployed model (e.g., `gpt-5.4-mini`), or create them during setup in Option 1.
2. **[.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)** or later.
3. **Foundry connections** (for deployment): an **ApiKey** connection `dummy-api-key` and a **CustomKeys** connection `dummy-custom-keys` (with a secret `secret-key` and a plain `plain-key`), as described in [How It Works](#how-it-works). The placeholders in `azure.yaml` resolve against these at container startup.

## Option 1: Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** — [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
2. Install the Foundry extension:

   ```bash
   azd ext install microsoft.foundry
   ```

3. Authenticate:

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

### Initialize the agent project

No cloning required. Create a new folder and initialize from the manifest:

```bash
mkdir env-vars-agent && cd env-vars-agent
azd ai agent init -m https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/csharp/hosted-agents/bring-your-own/responses/env-vars-agent/azure.yaml
```

Follow the prompts to configure your Foundry project and model deployment. If you don't have an existing Foundry project, `azd ai agent init` will guide you through creating one.

### Provision Azure resources (if needed)

If you don't already have a Foundry project and model deployment:

```bash
azd provision
```

### Run the agent locally

```bash
azd ai agent run
```

The agent host will start on `http://localhost:8088`.

### Invoke the local agent

Ask the agent about each env var. The tool returns whole values for `target`/`metadata` and a safe fingerprint for `credentials`:

```bash
# ApiKey target (whole value)
azd ai agent invoke --local "what is TARGET? it is the target of an ApiKey connection."

# ApiKey credentials (fingerprint only)
azd ai agent invoke --local "did SECRET_API_KEY resolve? it is a credentials placeholder."

# CustomKeys metadata (whole value)
azd ai agent invoke --local "what is NON_SECRET_KEY? it is metadata from a CustomKeys connection."

# CustomKeys credentials (fingerprint only)
azd ai agent invoke --local "did SECRET_KEY resolve? it is a credentials placeholder."
```

Or use curl directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "what is TARGET? it is the target of an ApiKey connection."}' \
  --no-buffer

curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "did SECRET_KEY resolve? it is a credentials placeholder."}' \
  --no-buffer
```

### Deploy to Foundry

Once tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
azd deploy
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Deploy a hosted agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/deploy-hosted-agent).

### Invoke the deployed agent

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "did SECRET_API_KEY resolve? it is a credentials placeholder."
```

Stream logs from the running agent with `azd ai agent monitor`.

## Option 2: VS Code (Foundry Toolkit)

### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code** with the **[Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio)** extension installed.
2. [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension.
3. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **C#: Check Workspace Requirements** to confirm the toolchain is ready.

### Run and debug the agent

Press **F5** to start the agent. The agent starts and the **Agent Inspector** opens automatically. Try a message such as:

```
what is TARGET? it is the target of an ApiKey connection.
```

### Or run manually, then open the Inspector

1. Sign in to Azure with the Azure CLI (`az login`) and build:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in any test values you like (the agent loads `.env` automatically on startup).

2. Start the agent: `dotnet run` (listens on `http://localhost:8088`).
3. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**, then send a message to test.

### Deploy to Foundry

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate settings.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to select subscription and project.
3. On the **Basics** tab, choose deployment method (**Code** or **Container**) and confirm the agent name.
4. On **Review + Deploy**, confirm runtime details, pick **CPU and Memory** size, and click **Deploy**.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.

## How the Connection Resolution Works

The resolver supports three placeholder paths today, mapped to the three parts of a connection:

| Path | Template syntax | Source on the connection | Use for |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------|---------|
| `credentials.<field>` | `${{connections.<name>.credentials.key}}` (ApiKey)<br>`${{connections.<name>.credentials.<key-name>}}` (CustomKeys secret) | The connection's secret store | API keys; CustomKeys entries marked **as secret** |
| `target` | `${{connections.<name>.target}}` | The connection's `target` field (endpoint URL) | Endpoints / base URLs |
| `metadata.<key>` | `${{connections.<name>.metadata.<key-name>}}` | The connection's `metadata` bag | Plain (non-secret) CustomKeys entries — region, account name, feature flags, etc. |

> **CustomKeys connections can mix both:** when you add a custom key, you choose whether it's a secret or not. Secret keys land in `credentials` and are reachable via `credentials.<key-name>`; non-secret keys land in `metadata` and are reachable via `metadata.<key-name>`. A single CustomKeys connection can hold any combination — which is exactly what `dummy-custom-keys` shows above.

When the agent container starts, the platform reads the connection by name, resolves each placeholder to the corresponding value, and injects it into the named env var. **Secrets are never persisted into the agent definition** — only the placeholder is stored. `target` and `metadata` values are *not* secrets; they are stored on the connection itself in plain text and surfaced verbatim, but the same placeholder mechanism keeps the manifest portable across environments.

The agent's `get_env_var(name, kind)` tool mirrors this three-way split: pass `kind=metadata` or `kind=target` to get the raw value back; pass `kind=credentials` (or omit it — it's the default) to get a safe fingerprint instead.

## File Layout

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Program.cs` | `ResponsesServer.Run<EnvVarsHandler>` startup + Responses-API function-calling loop with the `get_env_var` tool |
| `EnvVarsAgent.csproj` | net10.0 project — `Azure.AI.AgentServer.Responses` + `Azure.AI.Projects` + `Azure.AI.Extensions.OpenAI` |
| `azure.yaml` | Container agent spec (`kind: hosted`, protocol, resources) |
| `azure.yaml` | Foundry deployment manifest — model, env vars, connection placeholders |
| `Dockerfile` | Multi-stage net10.0-alpine build, exposes port 8088 |
| `.env.example` or `.env` | Template for local-run env vars |
| `.dockerignore` | Excludes build artifacts and `.env` from the container image |
| `README.md` | The README file |

## Troubleshooting

### An env var shows status `UNRESOLVED_PLACEHOLDER`

The secret resolver did not run or failed for that env var. Check:

- The connection named in `${{connections.<name>.<path>}}` exists in the project (or the parent account) with the **exact** name.
- For `CustomKeys` connections, the custom key name in the connection must match the `<field>` part of the template (case-sensitive).
- The `kind` you used in the placeholder matches where the field actually lives on the connection (a key marked as secret is in `credentials`, not `metadata`).
- The hosted-agent feature flag is enabled for the workspace.
- The agent was redeployed after the env var was added — connection resolution happens at container start.

### Azure OpenAI Permission Denied (401)

If you see an error like:

```
Error code: 401 - The principal <principal-id> lacks the required data action
Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/OpenAI/deployments/chat/completions/action ...
```

The identity running the agent does not have the required RBAC roles on the Azure AI Foundry project. Assign:

- **Cognitive Services OpenAI User**
- **Azure AI User**

```bash
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-subscription-id>"
RESOURCE_GROUP="<your-resource-group>"
PROJECT_NAME="<your-ai-foundry-project-name>"
PRINCIPAL_ID="<principal-id-from-error-message>"

az role assignment create \
  --assignee "$PRINCIPAL_ID" \
  --role "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RESOURCE_GROUP/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/$PROJECT_NAME"

az role assignment create \
  --assignee "$PRINCIPAL_ID" \
  --role "Azure AI User" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RESOURCE_GROUP/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/$PROJECT_NAME"
```

> **Note:** It may take a few minutes for role assignments to propagate.
