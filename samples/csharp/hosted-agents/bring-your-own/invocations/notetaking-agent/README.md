# Note-Taking Agent — Invocations Protocol

This sample demonstrates a note-taking agent built with [Azure.AI.AgentServer.Invocations](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.AgentServer.Invocations) that uses **Azure OpenAI function calling** for intent understanding, **SSE streaming** for real-time token delivery, and **local JSONL file storage** for session-persistent notes.

## How It Works

The agent receives natural language messages via `POST /invocations` and uses Azure OpenAI with two tool definitions — `save_note` and `get_notes` — to understand user intent. When the LLM returns a tool call, the agent executes it locally (reads/writes a JSONL file) and streams the LLM's natural language response back as Server-Sent Events.

Notes are stored per session in `notes_{session_id}.jsonl` files, demonstrating **session persistence** — notes survive across multiple invocations within the same session. The session ID is resolved automatically from the `agent_session_id` query parameter.

## Prerequisites

1. An existing Foundry project with a deployed model (e.g., `gpt-5.4-mini`), or create them during setup in Option 1.
2. **[.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)** or later.

## Option 1: Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** — [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
2. Install the Foundry extension:

   ```bash
   azd ext install microsoft.foundry
   ```

3. Authenticate:

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

### Initialize the agent project

No cloning required. Create a new folder and initialize from the manifest:

```bash
mkdir notetaking-agent && cd notetaking-agent
azd ai agent init -m https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/csharp/hosted-agents/bring-your-own/invocations/notetaking-agent/azure.yaml
```

Follow the prompts to configure your Foundry project and model deployment. If you don't have an existing Foundry project, `azd ai agent init` will guide you through creating one.

### Provision Azure resources (if needed)

If you don't already have a Foundry project and model deployment:

```bash
azd provision
```

### Run the agent locally

```bash
azd ai agent run
```

The agent host will start on `http://localhost:8088`.

### Invoke the local agent

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local '{"message": "save a note - book reservation for dinner"}'
```

In PowerShell:

```powershell
azd ai agent invoke --local '{\"message\": \"save a note - book reservation for dinner\"}'
```

Or use curl directly. Pass a stable `agent_session_id` to persist notes across calls; the `-N` flag streams SSE tokens as they arrive:

```bash
curl -N -X POST "http://localhost:8088/invocations?agent_session_id=my-session" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "save a note - book reservation for dinner"}'

curl -N -X POST "http://localhost:8088/invocations?agent_session_id=my-session" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "save a note - buy groceries"}'

curl -N -X POST "http://localhost:8088/invocations?agent_session_id=my-session" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "get all my notes"}'

# Start a new session
curl -N -X POST "http://localhost:8088/invocations?agent_session_id=new-session" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "get all my notes"}'
```

### Deploy to Foundry

Once tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
azd deploy
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Deploy a hosted agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/deploy-hosted-agent).

### Invoke the deployed agent

```bash
azd ai agent invoke '{"message": "save a note - book reservation for dinner"}'
```

Stream logs from the running agent with `azd ai agent monitor`.

## Option 2: VS Code (Foundry Toolkit)

### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code** with the **[Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio)** extension installed.
2. [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension.
3. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **C#: Check Workspace Requirements** to confirm the toolchain is ready.

### Run and debug the agent

Press **F5** to start the agent. The agent starts and the **Agent Inspector** opens automatically. Chat with the agent in the Inspector:

![Agent Inspector](../../../../assets/agent-inspector-invocations.png)

Try sending `{"message": "save a note - book reservation for dinner"}`, then `{"message": "get all my notes"}`. Click **Clear Conversation** (top-right) to start a new session.

### Or run manually, then open the Inspector

1. Sign in to Azure with the Azure CLI (`az login`), build, and set env values:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   cp .env.example .env  # then edit values (skip if .env already exists)
   export FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://your-project.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/your-project"
   export AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-5.4-mini"
   ```

2. Start the agent: `dotnet run` (listens on `http://localhost:8088`).
3. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**, then send a message to test.

### Deploy to Foundry

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate settings.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to select subscription and project.
3. On the **Basics** tab, choose deployment method (**Code** or **Container**) and confirm the agent name.
4. On **Review + Deploy**, confirm runtime details, pick **CPU and Memory** size, and click **Deploy**.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.

## Troubleshooting

### Azure OpenAI Permission Denied (401)

If you see an error like:

```
Error calling Azure OpenAI: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'code': 'PermissionDenied', 'message': 'The principal <principal-id> lacks the required data action Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/OpenAI/deployments/chat/completions/action to perform POST /openai/deployments/{deployment-id}/chat/completions operation.'}}
```

The identity running the agent does not have the required RBAC roles on the Azure AI Foundry project. Assign the following roles:

- **Cognitive Services OpenAI User**
- **Foundry User**

Use the Azure CLI to assign them:

```bash
# Set your variables
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-subscription-id>"
RESOURCE_GROUP="<your-resource-group>"
PROJECT_NAME="<your-ai-foundry-project-name>"
PRINCIPAL_ID="<principal-id-from-error-message>"

# Assign "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" role
az role assignment create \
  --assignee "$PRINCIPAL_ID" \
  --role "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RESOURCE_GROUP/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/$PROJECT_NAME"

# Assign "Foundry User" role
az role assignment create \
  --assignee "$PRINCIPAL_ID" \
  --role "Foundry User" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RESOURCE_GROUP/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/$PROJECT_NAME"
```

> **Note:** It may take a few minutes for role assignments to propagate. Retry the request after waiting.
