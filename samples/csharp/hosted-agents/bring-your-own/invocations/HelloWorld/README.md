# What this sample demonstrates

A minimal "hello world" hosted agent using the **Bring Your Own** approach with the **Invocations protocol** in C#. It shows how to use the [`Azure.AI.AgentServer.Invocations`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.AgentServer.Invocations/) SDK to host a custom agent that calls a Foundry model via the Responses API and returns the reply as a streaming SSE event stream.

This is the simplest possible BYO integration — the protocol SDK handles the HTTP endpoints, session resolution, client header forwarding, and OpenTelemetry tracing. You supply the model call using the [Foundry SDK (`Azure.AI.Projects` + `Azure.AI.Extensions.OpenAI`)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.Extensions.OpenAI/).

> **Invocations vs Responses:** Unlike the Responses protocol, the Invocations protocol does **not** provide built-in server-side conversation history. This agent maintains an in-memory session store keyed by `agent_session_id`. In production, replace it with durable storage (Redis, Cosmos DB, etc.) so history survives restarts.

## How It Works

### Model Integration

The agent uses the Foundry SDK to create a `ProjectResponsesClient` from the project endpoint and model deployment name. When a request arrives, the handler looks up the session history by `SessionId`, appends the new user message, calls the model via the Responses API with streaming, and writes SSE events directly to the response — `token` events during generation, then a final `done` event.

See [Program.cs](src/hello-world-dotnet-invocations/Program.cs) for the full implementation.

### Agent Hosting

The agent is hosted using the [Azure AI AgentServer Invocations SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.AgentServer.Invocations/), which provisions a REST API endpoint compatible with the Azure AI Invocations protocol.

### Agent Deployment

The hosted agent can be developed and deployed to Microsoft Foundry using the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/quickstarts/quickstart-hosted-agent?view=foundry&pivots=azd).

## Running the Agent Locally

### Prerequisites

Before running this sample, ensure you have:

1. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)**
   - [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) (1.25 or later) and the unified Foundry CLI extension: `azd ext install microsoft.foundry`
   - Authenticated: `azd auth login`

2. **Azure CLI**
   - Installed and authenticated: `az login`

3. **.NET 10.0 SDK or later**
   - Verify your version: `dotnet --version`
   - Download from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

> [!NOTE]
> You do **not** need an existing [Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-foundry?view=foundry) project or model deployment to get started — `azd provision` creates them for you. If you already have a project, see the [note below](#using-azd) on how to target it.

### Environment Variables

See [`.env.example`](src/hello-world-dotnet-invocations/.env.example) or `.env` for the full list of environment variables this sample uses.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | Yes | Foundry project endpoint. Auto-injected in hosted containers; set automatically by `azd ai agent run` locally. |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | Yes | Model deployment name — must match your Foundry project deployment. Declared in `azure.yaml`. |
| `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` | Recommended | Enables telemetry. Auto-injected in hosted containers; set manually for local dev. |

**Local development (without `azd`):**

```bash
# Set env vars directly — .NET does not natively read .env files
export FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
export AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="<your-model-deployment-name>"
```

> [!NOTE]
> When using `azd ai agent run`, environment variables are handled automatically — no manual setup needed.

### Running the Sample

Run and test hosted agents locally with the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) or the Foundry Toolkit VS Code extension.

<details>
<summary><h4>Using the Foundry Toolkit VS Code Extension</h4></summary>

The [Foundry Toolkit VS Code extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/quickstarts/quickstart-hosted-agent?view=foundry&pivots=vscode) has a built-in sample gallery. You can open this sample directly from the extension without cloning the repository, it scaffolds the project into a new workspace, generates `agent.yaml`, `.env`, and `.vscode/tasks.json` + `launch.json` automatically, and configures a one-click **F5** debug experience.

Chat with a running agent using the **Agent Inspector**:

1. Start the agent locally first using **Using `azd`** or **Manual setup** above. The agent listens on `http://localhost:8088/`.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**.
3. The Inspector auto-connects to the running agent. Send messages to chat with the agent and watch the streamed responses.

</details>

#### Using [`azd`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/quickstarts/quickstart-hosted-agent?view=foundry&pivots=azd)

No cloning required. Create a new folder, point `azd` at the manifest on GitHub, and it sets up the sample and adopts its `azure.yaml` as the project manifest and configures your environment automatically:

```bash
# Create a new folder for the agent and navigate into it
mkdir hello-world-agent && cd hello-world-agent

# Initialize from the manifest — azd reads it, downloads the sample,
# and adopts its azure.yaml as the project manifest and configures your environment
azd ai agent init -m https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/dotnet/hosted-agents/bring-your-own/invocations/HelloWorld/azure.yaml

# Provision Azure resources (Foundry project, model deployment, App Insights)
azd provision

# Run the agent locally (handles env vars, build, and startup)
azd ai agent run
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you've already cloned this repository, pass a local path to the manifest instead:
> `azd ai agent init -m <path-to-repo>/samples/dotnet/hosted-agents/bring-your-own/invocations/HelloWorld/azure.yaml`

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have a Foundry project and model deployment, add `-p <project-id> -d <deployment-name>` to `azd ai agent init` to target existing resources. You can also skip provisioning entirely and configure env vars manually — see [Manual setup](#manual-setup).

The agent starts on `http://localhost:8088/`. To invoke it:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "What is Microsoft Foundry?"
```

Or use curl directly. The `-N` flag disables output buffering so you see SSE tokens as they arrive:

> [!NOTE]
> `agent_session_id` is optional. If omitted, the server auto-generates one and returns it in the `done` event (`session_id` field). To continue a conversation across turns, pass the same `agent_session_id` in each request.

```bash
# Turn 1 — start a new conversation
curl -sS -N -X POST "http://localhost:8088/invocations?agent_session_id=chat-001" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is Microsoft Foundry?"}'

# Turn 2 — continue the same conversation
curl -sS -N -X POST "http://localhost:8088/invocations?agent_session_id=chat-001" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What hosted agent options does it offer?"}'
```

Each response is a stream of SSE events: `token` events with incremental text, followed by a `done` event with the complete reply.

#### Manual setup

If running without `azd`, set environment variables manually (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)), then:

```bash
dotnet run
```

### Deploying the Agent to Microsoft Foundry

Once you've tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
# Provision Azure resources (skip if already done during local setup)
azd provision

# Build, push, and deploy the agent to Foundry
azd deploy
```

After deploying, invoke the agent running in Foundry:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "What is Microsoft Foundry?"
```

To stream logs from the running agent:

```bash
azd ai agent monitor
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Azure AI Foundry hosted agents](https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs).

#### Deploying with the Foundry Toolkit VS Code Extension

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a tab-based **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate what it can.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to pick the subscription and Foundry project (or create a new one) to deploy to.
3. On the **Basics** tab, configure the core deployment settings:
   - **Deployment Method**: **Code** (upload as a ZIP) or **Container** (Docker image via ACR).
   - For **Code**, pick a packaging option: **Remote** or **Local**.
   - For **Container**, pick a registry option: default ACR, your own ACR, or a prebuilt ACR image.
   - **Hosted Agent Name**: confirm the name to register with the hosting service.
4. On the **Review + Deploy** tab, finalize the runtime and resources:
   - Confirm the auto-detected runtime details (language, entry point, or Dockerfile).
   - Pick a **CPU and Memory** size.
   - Click **Deploy**. Fields are validated inline, and the extension handles the build/upload, agent version creation, and RBAC role assignment.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.

## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

**Deploy with `azd deploy`**, which uses ACR remote build and always produces images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds:**

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t image .
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
