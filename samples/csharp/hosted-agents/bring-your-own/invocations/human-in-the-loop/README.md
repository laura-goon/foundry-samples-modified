# Human-in-the-Loop Agent (Invocations Protocol) — .NET

This sample demonstrates a human-in-the-loop agent built with [Azure.AI.AgentServer.Invocations](https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_packaging/azure-sdk-for-net/nuget/v3/index.json) that implements an **approval-gate pattern**. The agent generates a proposal using Azure OpenAI, pauses for human review, and resumes execution after the human approves, requests a revision, or rejects.

Session state is persisted as JSON files in the `$HOME` directory, so proposals survive agent restarts and are accessible via the **Session Files API** when deployed to Azure.

This pattern is useful for workflows where an AI agent should **not act autonomously** — for example, drafting communications, generating code changes, or proposing decisions that require human sign-off.

## How It Works

```
[new task] ──► AWAITING_APPROVAL ──► (approve) ──► COMPLETED
                    │
                    ├──► (revise + feedback) ──► AWAITING_APPROVAL (loop)
                    │
                    └──► (reject) ──► REJECTED
```

1. **Submit a task** via `POST /invocations` — the agent calls Azure OpenAI to generate a proposal and returns it with status `awaiting_approval`.
2. **The agent pauses** — the proposal is saved to disk, and the human can return at any time (minutes, hours, or days later).
3. **Respond with a decision** via another `POST /invocations` using the same `agent_session_id`:
   - `approve` — the agent marks the proposal as final and returns it.
   - `revise` (with feedback) — the agent generates an improved proposal incorporating the feedback.
   - `reject` — the agent marks the session as rejected.
4. **Poll status** via `GET /invocations/{id}` — useful for checking whether a proposal is still pending after reconnecting.
5. **Cancel** via `POST /invocations/{id}/cancel` — cancels a pending session.

## Prerequisites

1. An existing Foundry project with a deployed model (or create them during setup in Option 1).
2. **[.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)** or later.

### Environment variables

```bash
export FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/api/projects/proj"
export AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-5.4-mini"
```

## Option 1: Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)** — [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
2. Install the Foundry extension:

   ```bash
   azd ext install microsoft.foundry
   ```

3. Authenticate:

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

### Initialize the agent project

No cloning required. Create a new folder and initialize from the manifest:

```bash
mkdir human-in-the-loop-agent && cd human-in-the-loop-agent
azd ai agent init -m https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/csharp/hosted-agents/bring-your-own/invocations/human-in-the-loop/azure.yaml
```

Follow the prompts to configure your Foundry project and model deployment. If you don't have an existing Foundry project, `azd ai agent init` will guide you through creating one.

### Provision Azure resources (if needed)

If you don't already have a Foundry project and model deployment:

```bash
azd provision
```

### Run the agent locally

```bash
azd ai agent run
```

The agent host will start on `http://localhost:8088`.

### Invoke the local agent

In a separate terminal, submit a task:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local '{"task": "Write a product launch announcement for Azure AI Foundry"}'
```

In PowerShell:

```powershell
azd ai agent invoke --local '{\"task\": \"Write a product launch announcement for Azure AI Foundry\"}'
```

This sample uses an approval-gate flow — submit a task, then approve, revise, or reject via curl using the same `agent_session_id`:

```bash
# Step 1: Submit a task — agent generates a proposal
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8088/invocations?agent_session_id=session-1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task": "Draft a marketing email for our new AI product launch"}'
# -> {"status": "awaiting_approval", "proposal": "...", "session_id": "session-1", ...}

# Step 2: Check status (e.g., after reconnecting hours later)
curl http://localhost:8088/invocations/<invocation_id>
# -> {"status": "awaiting_approval", "proposal": "...", ...}

# Step 3a: Approve the proposal
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8088/invocations?agent_session_id=session-1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"decision": "approve"}'
# -> {"status": "completed", "final_output": "...", ...}

# Step 3b: Or request a revision with feedback
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8088/invocations?agent_session_id=session-1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"decision": "revise", "feedback": "Make the tone more casual and add a call-to-action"}'
# -> {"status": "awaiting_approval", "proposal": "<revised draft>", ...}

# Step 3c: Or reject
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8088/invocations?agent_session_id=session-1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"decision": "reject"}'
# -> {"status": "rejected", ...}

# Cancel a pending session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8088/invocations/<invocation_id>/cancel
# -> {"status": "cancelled", ...}
```

### Deploy to Foundry

Once tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
azd deploy
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Deploy a hosted agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/deploy-hosted-agent).

### Invoke the deployed agent

```bash
azd ai agent invoke '{"task": "Write a product launch announcement for Azure AI Foundry"}'
```

Stream logs from the running agent with `azd ai agent monitor`.

## Option 2: VS Code (Foundry Toolkit)

### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code** with the **[Foundry Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-windows-ai-studio.windows-ai-studio)** extension installed.
2. [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension.
3. Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **C#: Check Workspace Requirements** to confirm the toolchain is ready.

### Run and debug the agent

Press **F5** to start the agent. The agent starts and the **Agent Inspector** opens automatically. Chat with the agent in the Inspector.

### Or run manually, then open the Inspector

1. Restore dependencies:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

2. Set the required environment variables:

   ```bash
   export FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/api/projects/proj"
   export AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-5.4-mini"
   ```

3. Sign in to Azure with the Azure CLI:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

4. Start the agent (listens on `http://localhost:8088`):

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

5. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**, then send a message to test.

### Deploy to Foundry

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate settings.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to select subscription and project.
3. On the **Basics** tab, choose deployment method (**Code** or **Container**) and confirm the agent name.
4. On **Review + Deploy**, confirm runtime details, pick **CPU and Memory** size, and click **Deploy**.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.

## Troubleshooting

### Azure OpenAI Permission Denied (401)

If you see an error like:

```
Error calling Azure OpenAI: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'code': 'PermissionDenied', ...}}
```

The identity running the agent does not have the required RBAC roles on the Azure AI Foundry project. Assign the following roles:

- **Cognitive Services OpenAI User**
- **Foundry User**

Use the Azure CLI to assign them:

```bash
# Set your variables
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-subscription-id>"
RESOURCE_GROUP="<your-resource-group>"
PROJECT_NAME="<your-ai-foundry-project-name>"
PRINCIPAL_ID="<principal-id-from-error-message>"

# Assign "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" role
az role assignment create \
  --assignee "$PRINCIPAL_ID" \
  --role "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RESOURCE_GROUP/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/$PROJECT_NAME"

# Assign "Foundry User" role
az role assignment create \
  --assignee "$PRINCIPAL_ID" \
  --role "Foundry User" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RESOURCE_GROUP/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/$PROJECT_NAME"
```

> **Note:** It may take a few minutes for role assignments to propagate. Retry the request after waiting.
