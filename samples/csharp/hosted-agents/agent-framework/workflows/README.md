# What this sample demonstrates

A multi-agent workflow that chains three translation agents into a sequential pipeline: English → French → Spanish → English — the **Agent Workflows (Responses Protocol)** sample. Built with [Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework), it demonstrates how to compose multiple agents into a workflow where the output of one agent feeds into the next.

## How It Works

The workflow registers three translation agents — English→French, French→Spanish, and Spanish→English — and chains them in sequence. When a user sends text, the first agent translates it to French, the second translates the French output to Spanish, and the third translates the Spanish back to English. The final response contains three lines showing each intermediate translation.

See [Program.cs](src/workflows/Program.cs) for the full implementation.

## Running the Agent Locally

### Prerequisites

Before running this sample, ensure you have:

1. **Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)**
   - [Install azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) (1.25 or later) and the unified Foundry CLI extension: `azd ext install microsoft.foundry`
   - Authenticated: `azd auth login`

2. **Azure CLI**
   - Installed and authenticated: `az login`

3. **.NET 10.0 SDK or later**
   - Verify your version: `dotnet --version`
   - Download from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

> [!NOTE]
> You do **not** need an existing [Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-foundry?view=foundry) project or model deployment to get started — `azd provision` creates them for you. If you already have a project, see the [note below](#using-azd) on how to target it.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | Yes | Foundry project endpoint. Auto-injected in hosted containers; set automatically by `azd ai agent run` locally. |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | Yes | Model deployment name — must match your Foundry project deployment. Declared in `azure.yaml`. |
| `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` | Recommended | Enables telemetry. Auto-injected in hosted containers; set manually for local dev. |

**Local development (without `azd`):**

```bash
# Set env vars directly — .NET does not natively read .env files
export FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
export AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="<your-model-deployment-name>"
```

> [!NOTE]
> When using `azd ai agent run`, environment variables are handled automatically — no manual setup needed.

### Installing Dependencies

> [!NOTE]
> If using `azd ai agent run`, dependencies are restored automatically — skip to [Running the Sample](#running-the-sample).

Dependencies are restored automatically when building the project:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### Running the Sample

Run and test hosted agents locally with the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) or the Foundry Toolkit VS Code extension.

<details>
<summary><h4>Using the Foundry Toolkit VS Code Extension</h4></summary>

The [Foundry Toolkit VS Code extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/quickstarts/quickstart-hosted-agent?view=foundry&pivots=vscode) has a built-in sample gallery. You can open this sample directly from the extension without cloning the repository, it scaffolds the project into a new workspace, generates `agent.yaml`, `.env`, and `.vscode/tasks.json` + `launch.json` automatically, and configures a one-click **F5** debug experience.

Chat with a running agent using the **Agent Inspector**:

1. Start the agent locally first using **Using `azd`** or **Manual setup** above. The agent listens on `http://localhost:8088/`.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Open Agent Inspector**.
3. The Inspector auto-connects to the running agent. Send messages to chat with the agent and watch the streamed responses.

</details>

#### Using [`azd`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/agents/quickstarts/quickstart-hosted-agent?view=foundry&pivots=azd)

No cloning required. Create a new folder, point `azd` at the manifest on GitHub, and it sets up the sample and adopts its `azure.yaml` as the project manifest and configures your environment automatically:

```bash
# Create a new folder for the agent and navigate into it
mkdir workflows-agent && cd workflows-agent

# Initialize from the manifest — azd reads it, downloads the sample,
# and adopts its azure.yaml as the project manifest and configures your environment
azd ai agent init -m https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/main/samples/csharp/hosted-agents/agent-framework/workflows/azure.yaml

# Provision Azure resources (Foundry project, model deployment, App Insights)
azd provision

# Run the agent locally (handles env vars, build, and startup)
azd ai agent run
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you've already cloned this repository, pass a local path to the manifest instead:
> `azd ai agent init -m <path-to-repo>/samples/csharp/hosted-agents/agent-framework/workflows/azure.yaml`

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have a Foundry project and model deployment, add `-p <project-id> -d <deployment-name>` to `azd ai agent init` to target existing resources. You can also skip provisioning entirely and configure env vars manually — see [Manual setup](#manual-setup).

The agent starts on `http://localhost:8088/`. To invoke it:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
```

Or use curl directly:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", "stream": false}' | jq .
```

Expected output: three lines showing the text in French, Spanish, then back in English.

#### Manual setup

If running without `azd`, set environment variables manually (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)), then:

```bash
dotnet run
```

### Deploying the Agent to Microsoft Foundry

Once you've tested locally, deploy to Microsoft Foundry:

```bash
# Provision Azure resources (skip if already done during local setup)
azd provision

# Build, push, and deploy the agent to Foundry
azd deploy
```

After deploying, invoke the agent running in Foundry:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
```

To stream logs from the running agent:

```bash
azd ai agent monitor
```

For the full deployment guide, see [Azure AI Foundry hosted agents](https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs).

#### Deploying with the Foundry Toolkit VS Code Extension

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run **Foundry Toolkit: Deploy Hosted Agent**. The extension opens a tab-based **Deploy Hosted Agent** wizard and reads `agent.yaml` to auto-populate what it can.
2. If prompted, complete **Foundry Project Setup** to pick the subscription and Foundry project (or create a new one) to deploy to.
3. On the **Basics** tab, configure the core deployment settings:
   - **Deployment Method**: **Code** (upload as a ZIP) or **Container** (Docker image via ACR).
   - For **Code**, pick a packaging option: **Remote** or **Local**.
   - For **Container**, pick a registry option: default ACR, your own ACR, or a prebuilt ACR image.
   - **Hosted Agent Name**: confirm the name to register with the hosting service.
4. On the **Review + Deploy** tab, finalize the runtime and resources:
   - Confirm the auto-detected runtime details (language, entry point, or Dockerfile).
   - Pick a **CPU and Memory** size.
   - Click **Deploy**. Fields are validated inline, and the extension handles the build/upload, agent version creation, and RBAC role assignment.
5. After deployment, invoke the agent in the Agent Playground and stream live logs from the **Logs** tab.

## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

**Deploy with `azd deploy`**, which uses ACR remote build and always produces images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds:**

```bash
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t image .
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
